1. create new component file 
  ex: ContactCard.js
2. create component instances to use 
  ex: <ContactCard />
3. add import to file where component is used in order to access new instances
4. create props or "attributes" for each instance, unique to the dynamic information you are trying to pass
  <ContactCard name="Mr. Wiskerson" imgURL= "www.cat.com" phone="9824938438" email=""/>
5. add function parameter (props) to file where props will be passed

/*
The App component should render markup matching the design.html: the main element, a header with the h1 and a div with class 'App-list'.
The App component will accept 1 prop, store.
The store prop is an object with 2 keys: lists and allCards.
lists is an array of objects.
allCards is an object where each key is a card's ID and the value is the card object with a title and content.
You'll be given a dummy STORE object to pass to your App.
The App should render a List component for each of the items in the store.lists array.
Each instance of the List component should be passed 2 props (and a key). The 2 props are header and cards.
The header prop is a string for the List's header.
The cards prop will be an array of card objects.
You'll need to combine the cardIds array for the list with the allCards object.
